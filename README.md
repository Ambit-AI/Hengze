=======================================
Software Name for Python Roberta_model
=======================================

Introduction

-----
By tweeting a dataset of chats from a certain period of time, the machine is made to learn deeply, thus enabling it to automatically detect customer satisfaction in a conversation. The main feature of the software is that whenever a customer enters a sentence, the program automatically analyzes the satisfaction level of that sentence, displaying it in terms of positive Negative and Nature.

Features
-----
- Feature 1  Deep learning was used to get higher accuracy rates
- Feature 2  NVIDIA's cuda acceleration technology is used, thus reducing the time required for machine learning.
- Feature 3  Used a lot of Twitter chat data to better improve accuracy


System Requirements
-----
- Operating System: Windows 10, macOS, 
- Python Version:  Python 3.8 or above.


Installation
-----
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Ambit-AI/Hengze`
2. Navigate to the software directory: `cd SoftwareName`
3. Install required packages: `pip install pytorch、pip install transformers、pip install datasets、pip install numpy、pip install scipy`


Usage
-----
After running the train.py file and waiting for the machine to finish learning, run run_Roberta_model.py. Enter the sentence you want to test at the bottom of the subfile and the machine will display the results.
